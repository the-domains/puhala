Puhala.com has always been a bit of an experiment. I've owned the domain name since 1997 and it has gone through constant iterations and attempts at personal expression. Photography, blogging, social content -- or a mashup of the three.

For the first several years, I just hand-coded the HTML. I migrated to Wordpress sometime after 2000\. I tried Square Space for a while as well. Each time, I started over with the content.

It's time to start fresh again. Really fresh.
